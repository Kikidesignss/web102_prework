## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:
1. Typos made and caused unexpected behavior.
2. Forgetting to select the correct element or attach the event after the DOM has loaded can prevent buttons or forms from working.
3. CSS Styling Not Applying correctly, which I had to go back and fix later on.
